Formulas:
c -> t
c(9/5)+32 = t

t -> c
t-32(5/9) = c


We need to create two components, and a service. 
We need to make sure the service is injected and available to our components.

let's think about views/templates:
we will have 2 components, both visible at the same time.
    fahrenheit component   
    celsius component
each component will show its tempreture - we will use string interpolation here
each component requires an input element and this should be even bound to some property(variable)
    (we are not using banana-in-a-box syntax to do event&peroperty two-way binding, we will achieve the same 
    using event binding to get data from view to component, and string interp to go the other way)

next we need our service - converter - Remember not to add the words "service" or "component" to our names
write some number of methods to do the conversion in our service. 
When users type into one of the inputs, this change causes the conversion to occur.
