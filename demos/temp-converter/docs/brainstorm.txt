need the conversion equation

c -> t
c(9/5)+32 = t

t -> c
t-32(5/9) = c



all in one single component
three files for this component 
	template (html)
		the text and other visual items on screen
        lables
        input boxes - two way data binding 
        instructions
        button

	styling (css)
        make it look pretty
        component/visual elements layout - where on screen will things be?
        colors, box model

	component (ts)
        conversion equations - functions/methods/behaviors
        function for the button to do the conversions


Today's intro topics:
modules
components
directives
decorators
data binding one- and two-way [(Banana in a box)]



our conversion operation:
